Perfect üëç That‚Äôs a very good set of points for the **Risk Overlay** section ‚Äî it shows awareness of both **data security** and **technical risk management**.

Here‚Äôs a **professionally written version** of your **Risk Overlay** section:

### **Risk Overlay**

Throughout my internship, I proactively identified and mitigated potential risks related to data security and system compatibility:

* **Prevention of Sensitive Data Leakage:**
  While working with **GitHub Covalent**, I ensured that no sensitive or confidential information was exposed. Strict validation and review processes were followed to prevent any unintentional data leakage, maintaining compliance with security standards.

* **Cross-Platform Compatibility (HyperExecute):**
  During the **Vulkan to HyperExecute integration**, I addressed a key technical risk involving **Windows (Vulkan)** and **Linux (HyperExecute)** platform differences. I successfully modified Windows-specific logic to ensure seamless Linux compatibility without breaking the automation code, enabling a **cross-platform execution environment**.

These measures minimized operational risks and enhanced both the security and reliability of the overall implementation.

Would you like me to now create the **Overall Summary** section (which ties together your achievements, growth, and future goals in a concise closing paragraph)?
