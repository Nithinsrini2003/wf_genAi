Hey team, I’ll be logging off for the day and won’t be able to attend the stand-up call today.
Updates:
Connected with the HCL team regarding the Hyper-Execute migration. The DB issues in IBH are now fixed. I still need to complete the full validation in Hyper-Execute for IBH — once that’s done, IBH should be all good.
For the Maven to Gradle migration, I resolved the dependency and version incompatibility issues. All builds are now working fine, but currently, 84 out of 174 JUnit test cases are failing — I’ll work on fixing those next.
I’ll give the Hyper-Execute demo on Monday, as I’ll be on PTO tomorrow.
For Prasad, I’ll provide your updates once you’re back from vacation.
Thank you, team.
