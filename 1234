Your task: Migrate this complete repository from Maven to Gradle accurately and completely.

Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the existing Maven setup:**
   - Read all pom.xml files (including root and submodules).
   - Identify dependencies (with scopes), plugins, repositories, build profiles, and properties.
   - Note packaging types (jar, war, etc.), compiler settings, and module relationships.

2. **Generate Gradle configuration:**
   - Create a root-level `settings.gradle` and `build.gradle` file.
   - For each module, generate its own `build.gradle` reflecting its Maven pom.xml.
   - Replace Maven plugins with equivalent Gradle plugins or custom Gradle tasks.
   - Maintain all dependencies, repositories, and configurations exactly.
   - Preserve all project metadata, build logic, and environment variables.

3. **Ensure functional equivalence:**
   - The Gradle build should produce the same artifacts as the Maven build.
   - All tests, packaging, and dependency resolutions must work exactly as before.
   - For unsupported Maven plugins, implement their equivalent logic in Gradle.

4. **Code Style & DSL:**
   - If the project is Java-based, use **Groovy DSL** (`build.gradle`).
   - If the project involves Kotlin or modern tooling, use **Kotlin DSL** (`build.gradle.kts`).
   - Keep the structure modular, readable, and maintainable.

5. **Validation Steps:**
   - After migration, ensure the Gradle build runs successfully (`gradle build`).
   - Verify that all JAR/WAR outputs match previous Maven artifacts.
   - Confirm that test and dependency tasks execute successfully.

6. **Output Expected:**
   - Provide complete `settings.gradle` and `build.gradle` files for all modules.
   - Highlight any Maven plugin or configuration that required adaptation.
   - Include Gradle commands to build, test, and run the project.
