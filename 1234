During my six-month internship with the Public API team, I made significant contributions across multiple initiatives:
HyperExecute Integration (TCIE Team):
Successfully completed a full Proof of Concept (POC) and progressed halfway through the implementation of Vulkan to HyperExecute integration. This involved understanding the existing workflow, setting up configurations, and optimizing execution efficiency.

GenAI Project â€“ Delta API Comparison:
Ideated and developed a Proof of Concept (POC) for Delta API Comparison, enabling automated identification of differences between two API versions. This experimentation demonstrated the potential of leveraging GenAI for API comparison and enhanced efficiency in API version management.
WealthExchange Confluence Page:
Created a dedicated Confluence page for WealthExchange, consolidating setup guidelines, component details, and related documentation. This served as a centralized knowledge hub, improving accessibility and collaboration within the team.
