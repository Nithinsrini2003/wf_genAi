### **Areas of Focus**

In the upcoming months, my primary focus areas include completing and enhancing ongoing initiatives while deepening my domain understanding:

* **Completion of HyperExecute Integration:**
  Finalize the remaining **HyperX-030 mining part** by the end of October to make the HyperExecute setup fully functional and ready for the next regression cycle or release.

* **Productionization and Rollout (JAD):**
  By the end of the year, focus on the **JAD phase** to productionize the application and enable a smooth rollout to customers. This will involve stability checks, testing, and coordination with deployment teams.

* **Domain Knowledge Enhancement:**
  Spend more time understanding the **Foreign Exchange (FX)** domain, including the **FX state cycle**, various **applications under FX Online**, and the end-to-end operational flow. This will strengthen my technical contributions by aligning them more closely with business objectives.
